This prompt uses GPT-3/OpenAI Codex to generate code for building neural networks, Discord bots, and games. First, you will need to create a project folder and open it in the Terminal. Then, use the OpenAI Codex command line to generate code with GPT-3. You can generate code for a variety of different neural network architectures, Discord bots and games. Once you are satisfied with the generated code, you can save it to your project folder and start customizing it to your needs. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures, as well as different ML/DL libraries and frameworks. Enjoy the creative process of building your own neural networks, Discord bots, and games!
